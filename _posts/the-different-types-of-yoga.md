When you think of yoga, you probably think of poses and breathing, maybe even the music. But there are so many different kinds of practices that calling it “yoga” feels reductive. There are so many different types of yoga, each with a specific focus, that no single style can represent them all. It’s not just about which one is right for your body type or personal preferences — it’s also about which one speaks to you most and helps you achieve your goals as a yogi. Read on to discover more about the different types of yoga and which ones might suit you best.


## Hatha Yoga
Hatha yoga is the most common type of yoga, making it the “default” yoga. Hatha yoga is basically a practice that aims to bring balance to the body and the mind. Traditionally, people did hatha yoga at the end of the day when the sun was going down and it was cooling off. Hatha yoga is a great practice for beginners because it’s accessible to all bodies. It’s not as intense as other types of yoga, so you can start off slowly, gain confidence with the poses, and build up your fitness over time. Hatha yoga is great for beginners because it teaches you how to breathe properly and use your body as a tool.


## Vinyasa Yoga
Vinyasa yoga is a flowing practice where you move from one pose to the next with very little rest in between. You might move from a sun salutation to an upward facing dog, then a downward facing dog. Vinyasa yoga is great for building strength and endurance. It’s also really good at helping you find your flow and get into a meditative state. Vinyasa yoga is great for an active person who wants to challenge themselves and really push their limits. Vinyasa sometimes gets a bad rep for being too athletic. Vinyasa is great if you want to push yourself physically while also gaining mental clarity and focus. Vinyasa yoga is best for people who like to be active, want to push themselves physically, and get bored easily.


## Ashtanga Yoga
Ashtanga yoga is a set sequence of poses. The name “ashtanga” comes from a sanskrit word meaning “eight limbs,” which refers to the eight parts of the practice. Ashtanga yoga is a very traditional practice with roots in hatha yoga. Ashtanga yoga is great for building strength and endurance. It’s also really good at helping you find your flow and get into a meditative state. Ashtanga yoga is best for people who like structure and have a long-term goal for yoga. Ashtanga isn’t for everyone. It’s a very intense practice and takes a lot of dedication.


## Bikram and Hot Yoga
Bikram and hot yoga are types of hatha yoga practiced in a heated room. The heat is meant to loosen your muscles and improve flexibility, and the room is usually around 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Bikram is a sequence of 26 poses that are done in a specific order. Bikram and hot yoga will help you build strength and endurance, but it’s also really good at improving flexibility. It’s also great for stress relief and improving your focus.


## Integral Yoga
A relatively modern form of yoga, integral yoga was founded in the 1930s by Sri Yogendra. Integral yoga is a very meditative practice that aims to unite the body, breath, and mind to reach a state of “wholeness.” Integral yoga is great for beginners because it helps you develop a positive relationship with exercise and your body. If you’re someone who needs to learn how to love exercise and your body, integral yoga is a great practice for you. Integral yoga is a good practice for you if you’re a beginner who wants to learn to love exercise and your body.


## Iyengar Yoga
Iyengar yoga was created by B.K.S. Iyengar, who is widely considered to be the “father of modern yoga.” As the name suggests, Iyengar yoga is all about precision and alignment. It’s a slower, more deliberate practice that focuses on every movement and position. Iyengar yoga is a great practice for beginners because it helps you get to know your body. It’s a very slow-paced practice that puts more emphasis on the “why” of yoga than other types of yoga. Iyengar yoga is great for beginners who want to learn to love their bodies and understand how their bodies work.


## Kundalini and Cardio Yoga
Kundalini yoga is a set sequence of poses that is often practiced with music. It has roots in hatha yoga and was created by the Indian yogi named Yogi Bhajan. Cardio yoga is basically classes that replace your usual yoga practice with high-intensity, heart-pumping exercises. Both of these practices focus on building endurance, but they are very different. You can think of them as two different practices that happen to both be called yoga. Cardio yoga is great for people who want to get a workout and don’t care much about the “why” of yoga. Kundalini yoga is best for people who understand that yoga is more than just the poses. It’s about the journey, the meaning, and the experience.


## Yin Yoga
Yin yoga is a very meditative practice that is mostly done in a seated position. It’s a relatively new form of yoga with roots in Chinese Taoist philosophy. Yin yoga is great for beginners because it’s a slow-paced practice that allows you to really focus on your body and your breath. Yin yoga is great for people who want a calming and meditative practice. It’s great for beginners because you don’t have to worry about getting into the perfect position. Yin yoga is best for people who want a slow-paced, focused practice that focuses on the journey and the breath.



Yoga is a practice that can be tailored to your body, mind, and goals. No single yoga style can represent them all, so choose the one that speaks to you most and helps you achieve your goals. If you’re new to yoga, start with a hatha yoga flow sequence and find a studio that offers a variety of styles and teachers. Now that you know the different types of yoga, you can pick the one that works best for you.
