Intermittent fasting is a dieting method that involves cycles of fasting and eating. It has been around for centuries, but it has become more popular in recent years. Intermittent fasting has several different variations. Some of them are based on the idea that you can go without food for 24 hours and then eat only during a certain time period. Other forms involve alternating between periods of eating and fasting days.

## What is the 16/8 Method?

The 16/8 method is a type of intermittent fasting that entails fasting for 16 hours, and eating for 8 hours. There are many different ways to do intermittent fasting, but most plans include eating on a fixed schedule for a set number of hours per day and then fasting for the remaining hours. This might mean skipping breakfast, only eating between noon and 8pm, or any other variation.

## Health Benefits of intermittent fasting

Intermittent fasting is a relatively new dietary trend that is on the rise. For example, there was a study done on mice and they found that intermittent fasting can increase the lifespan of cells. This means that it can help to treat diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes. Other studies have shown that intermittent fasting has helped people lose weight and improve their moods. It's been shown to have a number of health benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity, increased fat oxidation and decreased risk of coronary heart disease.

One thing I've learned from all these different studies is that intermittent fasting is not a magic bullet. It's not a cure-all for weight loss, but some people are able to lose weight and improve their moods as long as they include fasting in their diet. Some people believe that the key to weight loss is dieting. Others think it's exercise. But there are many people who don't want to give up food or exercise in order to lose weight. Intermittent fasting may be the answer for them. Intermittent fasting is one of the fastest ways to lose weight. It not only helps in achieving your weight loss goals but also boosts your metabolism.

## Intermittent Fasting & Menstrual Cycles

Fasting has been used for centuries as a spiritual practice, and more recently as a weight loss method. But did you know that intermittent fasting could also have an impact on your menstrual cycle?

Women who fast intermittently may experience different cycles than those who eat regularly. Studies have found that women who fast intermittently are more likely to have longer cycles, or even skip periods altogether.

The reason for this is because of the way fasting affects hormone levels in the body. During a fast, there is less insulin in the blood, which can lead to hormonal changes that alter the menstrual cycle.
